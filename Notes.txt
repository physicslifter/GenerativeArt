1st element, minimal rules, 2 sides:
	1. random quadratic Bezier curve with no constraints
	2. random curve Bezier curve with the following constraints:
		A) endpoints must match with the endpoints of the first curve
		B) curve cannot overlap the first curve

"the second curve must intersect the first only at the two endpoints"
